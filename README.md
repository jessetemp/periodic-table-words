# periodic-table-words

The original list was cloned from a fork of this gist https://gist.github.com/jeffThompson/7789182

ptw_filter.py takes the original list and creates three new lists of words that are composed of 3, 4, or 5 symbols.

When the same word can be made from various symbol combinations, the first is kept and duplicates are discarded.
